## Overview
My first project all by myself. I felt extreme difficulty for not knowing some commands, being necessary to search on the internet.
It took two days of work on this simple code, and I'm a little disappointed by my delay. And I'm proud too, because I didn't copy any part of the code, it was difficult but it brought a lot of learning.

## My process
I started the process by creating the folders for your files and images.
Then I created the entire HTML part.
Then I styled it with CSS
and finally I reviewed and commented all the code.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
